  <h1>To My HR Family,</h1>

  <p>
There’s no easy way to say goodbye to a place that shaped so much of who I’ve become — and to people who became more than just officemates… you became home.

From shared deadlines to shared laughter, from sleepy mornings to tambay sa pantry, each moment we’ve spent together has made this journey unforgettable. And now that I’m closing this chapter, know that I’m carrying every memory, every lesson, and every kalog HR moment with me.

I may be signing out as a working student, but I’ll always be your kuya Yankee, Yanks, Yankee, diva — just with fewer shifts and more hugs from afar. 

Click the button below — I have something I want to say… face to screen 😅❤️
